TASK 1

1. Select the first ICMP Echo Request message sent by your computer, and expand the Internet Protocol part of the packet in the packet details window. What is the IP address of your computer?
>> expand packet #5

2. What is a router and network solicitation message?
>> The ICMP Router Solicitation message is sent from a computer host to any routers on the local area network to request that they advertise their presence on the network.

3. Within the IP packet header, what is the value in the upper layer protocol field?
>> udp (17 in decimal)

4. How many bytes are in the IP header? How many bytes are in the payload of the IP datagram? Explain how you determined the number of payload bytes.
>> IP header=20 Bytes, Bytes in payload of IP datagram=Total Length-IP header bytes=56-20=36 Bytes

5. Has this IP datagram been fragmented? Explain how you determined whether or not the datagram has been fragmented.
>> No because fragment offset in flags is set to 0.

6. Which fields in the IP datagram always change from one datagram to the next within this series of ICMP messages sent by your computer?
>> header checksum, identification {see packet #21,22,23 in sorted source listing}

7. Which fields stay constant? Which of the fields must stay constant? Which fields must change? Why?
>> version (IPv4), header length (20 bytes), source ip, dest ip, upper layer protocol (icmp)

8. What is the value in the Identification field and the TTL field?
>> {check packet #177} both values listed in IP header

9. Do these values remain unchanged for all of the ICMP TTL-exceeded replies sent to your computer by the nearest (first hop) router? Why?
>> identification should change (ideally), and ttl stays the same {see packets with same src}

10.Find the first ICMP Echo Request message that was sent by your computer after you changed the Packet Size in pingplotter to be 2000. Has that message been fragmented across more than one IP datagram?
>> yes. check packet #226,227

11. Print out the first fragment of the fragmented IP datagram. What information in the IP header indicates that the datagram has been fragmented? What information in the IP header indicates whether this is the first fragment versus a latter fragment? How long is this IP datagram?
>> 226	7.992984075	192.168.179.53	142.250.194.36	IPv4	1514	Fragmented IP protocol (proto=UDP 17, off=0, ID=3fd6) [Reassembled in #227]
flags of IP header tells more fragments (#226) but not for #227, #227 has fragment offset 1480
#226 IP datagram is 1500 bytes.

12. Print out the second fragment of the fragmented IP datagram. What information in the IP header indicates that this is not the first datagram fragment? Are there more fragments? How can you tell?
>> 227	7.993021382	192.168.179.53	142.250.194.36	UDP	534	59672 â†’ 33434 Len=1972
flags tell us no more fragments. not the first fragment since offset is 1480

13. What fields change in the IP header between the first and second fragment? Now find the first ICMP Echo Request message that was sent by your computer after you changed the Packet Size in pingplotter to be 3500.
>> length, flags, offset, checksum

14. How many fragments were created from the original datagram?
>> 3

15. What fields change in the IP header among the fragments?
>> The fields that change are the fragment offset (0, 1480, 2960) and checksum. The first 2 packets also have lengths of 1500 and more fragments flags set, while the last fragment is shorter (540) and does not have a flag set.

TASK 2

1. What is the IP address of your host? What is the IP address of the destination host?
>> Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: 192.168.179.53, Dst: 8.8.8.8

2. Why is it that an ICMP packet does not have source and destination port numbers?
>> There is no TCP or UDP port number associated with ICMP packets as these numbers are associated with the transport layer above.

3. Examine one of the ping request packets sent by your host. What are the ICMP type and code numbers? What other fields does this ICMP packet have? How many bytes are the checksum, sequence number, and identifier fields?
>> check packet #19
type=8, code=0; checksum, sequence number, and identifier fields 2 bytes each

4. Examine the corresponding ping reply packet. What are the ICMP type and code numbers? What other fields does this ICMP packet have? How many bytes are the checksum, sequence number and identifier fields?
>> type=0, code=0; checksum, sequence number, and identifier fields 2 bytes each


TASK 3

1. What is the IP address of your host? What is the IP address of the target destination host?
>> Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: 192.168.179.53, Dst: 8.8.8.8

2. If ICMP sent UDP packets instead (as in Unix/Linux), would the IP protocol number still be 01 for the probe packets? If not, what would it be?
>> no it is 17 for udp {check packet #1}

3. Examine the ICMP echo packet in your screenshot. Is this different from the ICMP ping query packets in the first half of this lab? If yes, how so?
>> The ICMP echo packet has the same fields as the ping query packets

4. Examine the ICMP error packet in your screenshot. It has more fields than the ICMP echo packet. What is included in those fields?
>> The ICMP error packet is not the same as the ping query packets. It contains both the IP header and the first 8 bytes of the original ICMP packet that the error is for.
check packets #1,17. expand header ICMP and see IPv4 sub header in #17

5. Examine the last three ICMP packets received by the source host. How are these packets different from the ICMP error packets? Why are they different?
>> {ideally} The last three ICMP packets are message type 0 (echo reply) rather than 11 (TTL expired). They are different because the datagrams have made it all the way to the destination host before the TTL expired.

6. Within the tracert measurements, is there a link whose delay is significantly longer than others? (Refer the traceroute window).
>> check individual traceroute measurements, might change for every measurement
